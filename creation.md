### 0. Talk - is cheap
Avoid simply talking to others. One of the best ways to waste a lot of time is to talk endlessly about things. Instead of talking, we ought to focus on at least the next step (writing) things down. In a meeting with N people, each 5 minutes of talking are using up N*5 minutes of overall team's time. Meanwhile, no re-referencable artefact gets created, making it hard for other members of the team to remember what got discussed in the meeting.

### 1. Words - create worlds 
Before we can create anything we need to write it into existence. The simplest way to write ideas down is to use [Super Simple Stories](https://github.com/flexewebs/Integral-White-Papers/blob/master/supersimplestories.md). More we focus on essence and core of the matters, the better. Words are commands which enable manifestation of the metaphysical into physical truth. 

### 2. Picture - says a thousand words
As soon as we write down what we want to create, we can start picturing, drawing or illustrating it. This is because human mind and brain is very well geared to recognise symbols and images. These symbols and images can tell different stories in different contexts. Symbolic and visual stories are much more impactful on people than written stories. 

### 3. Prototype - says a thousand pictures
Once we create pictures of core interaction points, we can link up those interaction points into a prototype that can be 'played' as a sequence of transitions and transactions. The prototype helps us much better understand what works and what doesn't as a more of a 'living thing'.  

### 4. Code - is truth
Whatever can be coded should be coded as soon as possible. Using atomic design principles outlined in the [Making Perfect Software](https://github.com/flexewebs/books/blob/main/MakingPerfectSoftware.md) we can bring the creation to even more life by codifying its intended behaviours into real world operating system.  

### 5. Release - is reality
Once the coded or prototyped creation we make gets seen by other people, it starts being truly tested. Sooner we bring our creation to the eyes of other people, the sooner we are going to know whether it really works or not. Releasing the creation into the 'wild' is the main way to ensure this testing gets done. Releases can be into the 'open' world, or can be more controlled to only selected group(s) of people to run smaller tests. 

### 6. Experience - is the product
The point of releasing our creation is to help create experiences in other people who are willing, able and want to use our creation. Experience is the product in the eyes, minds and bodies of our customers and users. Customers cannot experience something that has not been released yet. 

### 7. Transformation - is the goal
Even though experience is the product, the ultimate goal of our creation is to impact on humanity (Redesign Humanity) and help create a better world out there for all people we can possibly effect with our creations. Design and creations are the ultimate drivers of worldwide transformation that lasts for a long time.

## Integral content production

### 1. Plan 
Make as many decisions on what is in scope of the given unit of creation. Lay it out neatly and clearly. Use [Super Simple Stories](https://github.com/flexewebs/Integral-White-Papers/blob/master/supersimplestories.md) to describe things as much as possible. Keep it simple. The outcome of this activity will give you a plan for how to carry out the rest of the creative task. 

### 2. Prepare
Get together all the building blocks necessary to create with. These might include: content, ideas, explorations, references, resources, visuals, quotes, texts, etc. Get them all into one place from which you can reference it. The outcome of this activity will give you all the raw materials for production of next level of content. 

### 3. Produce 
Use the prepared materials to produce your creation. Combine and integrate those materials to produce that which is your intended creation. Production is the process of creating value at 10x or higher order. When producing be as creative as necessary to create high quality and high value outcomes. Production will yield a new piece of creation which will be worthy of publishing to relevant channels. 

### 4. Publish 
Once the creation is produced, it might still need some refining to publish it into relevant format(s). Publication is required to promote the creation. Publication can be to internal collaborators only or to a public domain, depending on what the intent is. Published creation can be shared and promoted via URLs or in other ways. 

### 5. Promote 
Share your creation in as soft a form as possible when you have done publishing it. Share a URL to the creation (pass by reference), rather than creation itself, especially when we are dealing with dynamic media references where the creation may exist as a 'living document' which keeps evolving and going through a set of versions over time.
